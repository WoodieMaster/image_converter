# Image Converter

A simple website to locally convert images from one format to another.

## How it works
1. Go to the website
2. Choose the target image format. Default is png
3. Select or Drag & Drop your images
4. Your images will automatically be downloaded to your computer if the save option is enabled (default) or you will see a preview of all your images in a grid if the save option is disabled.

## Future Plans
So far I won't be adding any more features, but if you have any ideas/issues please let me know and I will address them as soon as possible!
